# Find-A-Doc.io


## Purpose
I wanted to create a web app that would allow users to search for medical providers in their area or any other city in the US.

## Demo

User can search for provider by selecting a state and entering a city.

And

User may search narrow for specific doctors by entering a medical issue such as cold, asthma, diarrhead, etc along with city and state.

If user enters invalid information or no information is found, app will return a 'No results found message' to user.
