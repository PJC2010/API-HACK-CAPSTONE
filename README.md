# Find-A-Doc.io


## Purpose
I wanted to create a web app that would allow users to search for medical providers in their area or any other city in the US.

## Demo

User can search for provider by selecting a state, entering a city, and medical condition.

Or

User may search for provider by state, city, and doctor name(first or last).

If user enters invalid information or no information is found, app will return a 'No results found message' to user.
